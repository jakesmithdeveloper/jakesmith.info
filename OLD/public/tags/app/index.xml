      <description>PacePro is ultimately a gift to me, but I published it to the app store, hoping runners of all levels will find it as helpful as I intended.
Over the last year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve started taking running more seriously. What began as a hobby to improve my health turned into something containing goals and aspirations. As I dug deeper into the sport, I realized there were some essential tools and calculations that I kept needing.</description>

      <description>RaceDate tldr: various date calculators for the purpose of races and training plans
With my previous web app Stand Time, I set out to build something that I wanted to use. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that this is a good internal compass for side projects and such. Turns out I don&amp;rsquo;t really care much about the time I spend standing vs sitting, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay the thought was there, and experience learned along the way.</description>

      <description>TLDR: two stopwatches&amp;hellip; one for when you&amp;rsquo;re sitting, one for when you&amp;rsquo;re standing
Last year I decided I would upgrade my home office setup by getting a motorized desk so I could alternate between sitting and standing while working. Turns out that when given the choice, I really like sitting. So I built this little app to keep track of how long I&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting, and hopefully remind me that I could be standing more.</description>

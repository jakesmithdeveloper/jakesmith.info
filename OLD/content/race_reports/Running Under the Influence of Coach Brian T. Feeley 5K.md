### Thoughts

This race was put on by one of the members of my running club, so I had been looking forward to it for the last few months.  Race day marked the end of week three of my marathon training plan and I would say that I’m starting to get back into the swing of things.  My 5k the week prior was 23:16, so this result was a combination of slightly improved fitness and my current maximum effort.

My race strategy was to try and stick with other members of my running club in hopes that running as a group would help me zone out while going full throttle.  Unfortunately, (as with most races) this turned into going out way too hot and trying to hold on as long as possible.  This is undoubtedly a habit that needs breaking before the big race.

It seems that my current 5k pace is around 7-7:15/mile.  This isn’t where I would like to be, but is an accurate reflection of where I’m at in my training.  Anything faster is going to require more training, and a cleaner diet.

Overall, I had a great time with friends and look forward to continuing my training block as the weekly totals start to increase

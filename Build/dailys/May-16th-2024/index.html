I’ve been following Merlin since he co-created the podcast <a href="https://dobyfriday.com/">Do By Friday</a>, which led to discoveries of all of his podcasts on the Relay FM network.  His recent passion project is something that he’s been calling “<a href="https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md">Merlin’s Wisdom Project</a>,” and it’s one of my favorite things to peruse when I find myself bored on my computer.  It’s basically just a bulleted list of easily digestible wisdom told from the perspective of Merlin based on his own life experience.</p><h3>Some of my favorites include</h3><ul><li>Say hello to every dog.</li><li>Always wave back at children and all persons on trains.</li><li>Flirt with all elderly women.</li><li>If you see someone photographing a group, offer to take the photo for them so they can get in the picture. Please do not steal their camera.</li><li>Related: when you shoot a group photo, always take at least five shots from at least two angles. For the last couple photos, say: “Everybody say ‘BUTTS!’” You will instantly get many totally natural smiles, plus you just gave them a fun story.</li><li>Sometimes in life, even though it’s not your fault, it’s still your problem.</li></ul><p><strong>The one that matters the most for this post</strong></p><ul><li><em>Write at least a paragraph a day. Of something.</em></li></ul><p>When I read this, I thought to myself, when was the last time I wrote something just for the sake of writing something?  It bothered me to the extent that I created this new section on my site to start a daily writing habit.  I don’t know the kinds of things I’ll be writing about but I’m excited to get started and hopefully become a better writer over time.</p></div></div><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
